Sparked the idea of making a game
>The idea of the game being… 

>You play an imprisoned witch who’s only spell is to use explosives to physically affect objects.
>Backstory: the witch, Glinda, has been stripped from her power, and with luck and unawareness of some of the things she hides, has leftover potions of unstable magic that just creates explosions.
Mechanic: Use throwable explosions to traverse between levels and break down obstacles!
The twist: You have a limited amount of potions!
Prototyping by Paper: Documented the initial details of our game such as
Theme, Synopsis
Mechanics (Win/Lose, Core, Constraints, Advantages, etc.)
Challenges of the process, challenges for the player
Innovation, and the enjoyability of the game

    >A witch who can only move around using explosive magic? Yikes! >Talk about masochism! We wanted to keep it simple but try to invent using renowned mechanics from the games we love. >In this case, we are combining the use of physics based movement with scare resources to make the game a challenging and unique one. For this reason, we established ourselves as Team HOP! We are looking forward to a jumpstart in the project.
